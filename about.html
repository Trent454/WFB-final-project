            <p class="pt">Designed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, it debuted in North America on October 27, 2002 for PlayStation 2 and quickly became the best-selling video game of the year. Following this success, GTA Vice City saw releases in Europe, Australia and Japan, and became available on PC and Xbox. Later, Rockstar Vienna packaged the game with its predecessor, GTA III, and sold it as the Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack for Xbox, and finally it debuted for iOS and Android December 6, 2012 as a celebration of its 10-year anniversary. As of April 2015, GTA Vice City is the fourth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time in the United States. GTA Vice City also appeared on the Japanese magazine Famitsu's readers' list of 100 all-time favorite videogames in 2006.</p>

               <p> Its original release version uses a tweaked version of the RenderWare game engine used by GTA III, and similarly presents a huge cityscape, fully populated with buildings (from hotels to skyscrapers), vehicles (cars, motorcycles, boats, helicopters, and planes) and people.</p>
                
               <p> On November 11, 2021, the game was re-released on 8th and 9th generation consoles in honor of Grand Theft Auto III's 20-year anniversary under the title Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - The Definitive Edition, included in the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition bundle.</p>
